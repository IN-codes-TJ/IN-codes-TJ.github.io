# Motivations
I want to have somewhere to store some of my projects, and to quickly show others what I've been working on. That's what this will be! A portfolio for my work.

# Expectations
As I am in university, I am expecting this project to take a while. So if you're here to see a quickly-completed project - go away because you're not getting that xD. Quality, not quantity!
