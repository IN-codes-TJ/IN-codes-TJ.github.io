            <h2>MONSTERA</h2>
            <main>
                <p>Often called the Swiss Cheese plant, the Monstera's giant leaves feature gaping slits on either sides of the midrib. It's dark green leaves come from a large petiole, attached to the node via its stem. From this, lighter green leaves emerge. </p>
                <p>Originting from Southern Mexico, this plant loves a humidity of 60% to 80%, temperatures being between 18 degrees Celcius and 35 degrees Celcius. </p>
                <p>For maximum growth, this plant should be kept in bright, indirect light. Too bright and the leaves will burn; not enough light and the growth will be stunted. You should water this plant every 1-2 weeks, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings, without keeping it bone-dry for extended periods of time.</p>

            <h2>SPIDER PLANT</h2>
            <main>
                <p>Boasting long, striped leaves of green and white/yellow, the spider plant is among many plant-lovers favourites. It is an easy-to-please plant, all while looking beautiful. Once it reaches a certain size, it will begin to grow pale stems from its centre, from which baby plants will grow. You can easily propagate this plant by cutting the baby shoots from this new stem.</p>
                <p>Native to coastal areas of South Africa, a humidity of 40%-80% will do. It prefers temperatures above 13 degrees Celcius. </p>
                <p>The spider plant does best in medium light levels, and can tolerate lots of shade. However, too much light may burn their leaves, creating dry brown spots. This plant can survive throughout droughts, but the best growth is seen if watered when the soil is dry. </p>

            <h2>ALOCASIA</h2>
            <main>
                <p>There are many varieties of Alocasia, but all of them consist of larger leaves coming from stems, connected at a energy-containing node. Always displaying beautifully patterned leaves or stems, alocasias are a wonder to look at. </p>
                <p>Native to Asia, Southeast Asia and Australia, Alocasias usually prefer humidities between 45% and 80%. Temperatures between 18 degrees Celcius and 29 degrees Celcius are preferred. </p>
                <p>Alocasias prefer bright, indirect lighting, and to be watered when the top 2-3 inches of the soil are dry. Although they are known for being difficult to look after, if you carefully consider their care and try not to stress this plant out too much, it will thrive. </p>
